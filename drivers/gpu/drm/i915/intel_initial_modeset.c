/**
 * DOC: Boot-time mode setting.
 *
 * There exists a use case where the kernel graphics needs to be initialized
 * with a valid display configuration with full display pipeline programming
 * in place before user space is initialized and without a fbdev & fb console.
 *
 * The primary motivation is to allow early user space applications to
 * display a frame (or frames) as soon as possible after user space starts.
 * Eliminating the time it takes userspace to program the display configuration
 * benefits this use case.
 *
 * By doing all the display programming in the kernel, it can be done in
 * parallel with other kernel startup tasks without adding significant
 * elapshed time before user space starts.
